# 🧪 Ex.No.10: Use Ghidra to Disassemble and Analyze the Malware Code

---

## 🎯 Aim
To analyze running processes on a Windows system using **Process Explorer** and identify suspicious or malicious activities based on process behavior, properties, and resource usage.

---

## 🧰 Project Objectives :

* To provide a hands-on guide to disassembling and analyzing malware with **Ghidra**.
* To enable readers to recognize common malware functionalities, such as **persistence mechanisms**, **anti-analysis techniques**, and **network communications**.
* To equip users with the skills to interpret low-level assembly code and understand high-level behaviors using Ghidra's decompiler.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites :

* **Ghidra:** Installed and configured (requires Java Development Kit - JDK).
* **Virtual Machine (VM):** A secure, isolated, and virtualized environment (e.g., VMWare, VirtualBox) to safely handle binaries.
* **Sample Binary:** A benign sample or a controlled, safe hex dump for analysis (due to ethical/safety concerns).

#### B. Initial Analysis
* **Loading the Binary:** How to launch Ghidra, create a new project, and import the sample binary.
* **Auto-Analysis:** How to run the initial Ghidra auto-analysis and select appropriate analyzers.
* **Identifying Entry Points:** Locating the main function or the binary's execution starting point.

#### C. Function Analysis
* **Decompilation:** Using Ghidra's Decompiler window to translate assembly into high-level C-like code.
* **Function Identification:** Methods for renaming and analyzing critical functions to understand their purpose.
* **Cross-Referencing (XREF):** Utilizing Ghidra's cross-referencing features to trace where a function is called or where a variable is used.

#### D. String and Import Analysis
* **Locating Strings:** Using the **Defined Strings** window to find meaningful static strings (e.g., URLs, file paths, registry keys) that indicate malicious behavior.
* **Interpreting Imports:** Analyzing the **Import Table** to identify relevant imported functions (e.g., `CreateFileA`, `URLDownloadToFile`, `RegSetValueEx`) that suggest malware functionality.

#### E. Advanced Techniques (Optional)
* Introduction to using Ghidra's **Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)** for visualizing program execution flow.
* Examples of writing and running custom Ghidra scripts (Python/Java) for automation.

### 🧩 3. Example Automation Scripts (`scripts/`)

Scripts using Ghidra's API to automate repetitive analysis tasks:

| Script Example | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `extract_strings.py` | Automates the extraction and listing of all unique string references in the binary. |
| `network_analysis.py` | Identifies and flags functions that contain network-related API calls (e.g., `socket`, `connect`, `send`). |
| `label_functions.py` | Automates the labeling of functions and data segments based on known malicious patterns (e.g., file system manipulation, registry edits). |

---

### 🧩 4. Sample Data (`samples/`)

* **Benign Binary or Hex Dump:** Provide safe files for users to practice the disassembly steps.
    * *Example:* `benign_sample1.bin` (A simple C program that mimics system calls or file writing but contains no harmful payload).

### 🧾 Results

Process Explorer successfully listed all system and user processes.
A suspicious process (svchost.exe in user directory) was identified:
Unverified signature
Abnormal file location
Reported as malicious by VirusTotal
Process was analyzed, documented, and safely terminated.
All observations were recorded with timestamps and hashes.

---

### 🧠 Conclusion

Using Process Explorer, we can effectively detect and analyze suspicious system processes by monitoring:
Process hierarchy and relationships
Signature verification
CPU/memory/network behavior
VirusTotal detection results
This tool is a vital component in Windows forensic and malware triage investigations.

---

### ⚠️ Notes

Always cross-check results with VirusTotal and other analysis tools.
Do not terminate system-critical processes without full verification.
Keep Process Explorer updated to ensure accurate VirusTotal integration.
Always run investigations in a controlled forensic environment.
