# üß™ Ex-7.No. ‚Äî AFLogical OSE: Extracting Data from an Android Device

---

## üéØ Aim
To extract logical data from an Android device using **AFLogical OSE** (Open Source Edition) and produce a documented forensic export suitable for analysis and reporting.

---

## üìñ Description
**AFLogical OSE (Open Source Edition)** is a tool designed for logical data extraction from Android devices. As part of the Open Source Android Forensics project, it collects non-file system data like **contacts**, **messages (SMS/MMS)**, and **call logs** without needing root access.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Requirements
- **AFLogical OSE** (APK or host-side version)
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
- Android device and USB cable
- **Hashing utility:** `certutil` / `sha256sum`
- **SQLite Browser** for database analysis
- Forensic workstation with drivers and write-protected storage
- Screenshot capture for documentation

---

## üìù Pre-Acquisition Checklist
1. Obtain written consent or warrant before acquisition.  
2. Label and photograph the Android device (front, back, identifiers).  
3. Enable **Airplane Mode** (if applicable) to prevent remote interference.  
4. Note device information:
   - Model, OS version  
   - IMEI / Serial number  
   - Battery level and state  
5. Create a working directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir D:\Case_07_AFLogical\
   cd D:\Case_07_AFLogical\

## üß© Procedure ‚Äî Logical Extraction using AFLogical OSE

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

1.  **Download AFLogical OSE:**
    * Visit the AFLogical OSE GitHub page and download the latest release, or clone the repository using Git.
2.  **Install Java:**
    * AFLogical OSE requires Java to run. Ensure Java is installed on your machine.
3.  **Install Android Debug Bridge (ADB):**
    * Download **ADB** (a command-line tool for device communication) from the Android Developer's website.
    * Install it on your system and **add it to your system's PATH environment variable** for easy access from the command line.
4.  **Enable USB Debugging on the Android Device:**
    * Go to **Settings > About Phone** and tap **Build Number seven times** to enable Developer Options.
    * Go to **Settings > Developer Options** and enable **USB Debugging**.

---

### 2. Connect the Android Device to Your Computer

1.  **Connect via USB:**
    * Use a USB cable to connect the Android device to your computer.
2.  **Verify ADB Connection:**
    * Open Command Prompt/Terminal and run the following command:
        ```bash
        adb devices
        ```
    * **Verification:** The device should be listed, confirming that the ADB connection is ready.

### 3. Extract Data Using AFLogical OSE

1.  **Push the APK to the Android Device:**
    * Navigate to the AFLogical OSE directory in your terminal.
    * Run the command to install the AFLogical OSE APK on the device:
        ```bash
        adb install aflogical.apk
        ```
2.  **Launch the AFLogical OSE App on the Device:**
    * On the Android device, open the newly installed AFLogical app.
3.  **Select and Start Data Extraction:**
    * Select the desired data types (e.g., contacts, SMS, MMS, call logs) from the app's options.
    * The app will start the extraction process, storing the data in **.csv files** on the device‚Äôs storage, typically in a directory named `aflogical`.

---

### 4. Transfer Extracted Data to Your Computer

1.  **Use ADB to Pull Data:**
    * After extraction is complete, transfer the collected data files from the Android device to your computer using the `adb pull` command:
        ```bash
        adb pull /sdcard/aflogical /path/to/destination
        ```
    * *Note: Replace `/path/to/destination` with the desired save location on your computer.*
2.  **Verify the Data:**
    * Navigate to the destination directory and check the `.csv` files to ensure all required data has been successfully transferred.

---

### 5. Analyze the Extracted Data

1.  **Open the CSV Files:**
    * Use applications like **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, or a text editor to open and analyze the `.csv` files containing the extracted logical data.
2.  **Review and Document:**
    * Carefully review the data for any relevant evidence or information.
    * Document all findings and prepare a comprehensive report.

---

### 6. Clean Up

1.  **Uninstall AFLogical OSE:**
    * Once data extraction is complete and verified, safely uninstall the app from the Android device:
        ```bash
        adb uninstall com.viaforensics.android.aflogical
        ```
2.  **Disconnect the Device:**
    * Safely disconnect the Android device from your computer.

By following these steps, you successfully perform a logical extraction on an Android device using AFLogical OSE, a valuable technique in digital forensic investigations.
