# Ex.No.1    FTK Imager: A Forensic Imaging Tool Overview
## üéØ Aim  
To learn and perform forensic acquisition of digital evidence using **FTK Imager Toolkit**, and to understand how to create, verify, and analyze forensic images step by step.  

## üìñ Description  
FTK Imager is a forensic imaging tool that allows investigators to create exact copies of digital storage devices or files without altering the original evidence. It helps in capturing forensic images, verifying their integrity through hash values, and previewing file systems. The tool is widely used in digital forensics for evidence acquisition and preliminary analysis.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Required  
-  A computer with **FTK Imager** installed  
-  Sample storage media / disk image for testing  
-  External storage device (to save the acquired image)  
-  Screenshots captured during each step of the process  

## üìù Procedure

<br>


### Steps to Capture RAM Using FTK Imager
<br>

### 1. Run as Administrator

<br>
<br>

### 2. Initiate Memory Capture
- In the top menu bar, click **File ‚Üí Capture Memory...** from the dropdown list.

<br>
<br>

### 3. Configure Destination
A dialog box will appear where you configure where and how the memory will be saved.

- **Destination Path:**  
  Click **Browse** to select a folder on an **external drive** (not the system drive).  

- **Destination Filename:**  
  You can keep the default `memdump.mem` or assign a more descriptive name.

- **Optional: Include pagefile.sys**  
  Check this box to capture `pagefile.sys`, which is virtual memory stored on the disk.  
  > Note: This may increase capture size and duration, but can contain valuable artifacts.

- **Optional: Create AD1 file**  
  Saves the memory dump in an AccessData-specific container file.  
  > Generally not necessary if using tools like **Volatility** for analysis.

<br>
<br>

### 5. Wait for Completion
- A progress bar will indicate the capture status.  
- Capture time depends on the system‚Äôs RAM size.  
- Once finished, the memory dump file will be available in the destination folder.

## Acquiring Non-Volatile Memory (Disk Image) Using FTK Imager


### 1. Start the Process
- In FTK Imager, go to the top menu bar: **File ‚Üí Create Disk Image...**.

<br>
<br>
<img width="1919" height="1016"src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df90df51-2328-4ac7-b6db-870e4860793e" />


<br>
<br>

### 2. Select Source Evidence Type
A window will appear asking you to choose the source type:

- **Physical Drive:** Images the entire disk, including all partitions, unallocated space, and the Master Boot Record (MBR).  
- **Logical Drive:** Images a specific partition (e.g., C: drive).  
- **Image File:** Converts or copies an existing image file.  
- **Contents of a Folder:** Creates an image of a specific folder only.  

> **Tip:** For full forensic imaging, select **Physical Drive**.

</p>
<br>
<br>

### 3. Select the Source Drive
- From the dropdown, choose the physical drive to image (connected via **write-blocker**).  
- Click **Finish**.

### 6. Completion and Hash Verification
- The imaging process may take time depending on the drive size.  
- After completion, FTK Imager verifies the hashes automatically.  
- A final window shows **MD5** and **SHA1** hashes for both the source drive and image.  
- Matching hashes confirm the forensic image‚Äôs integrity.

---
## Notes

- Always use a **write-blocker** to prevent modifications to the evidence.  
- **Hash verification** is critical to maintain a chain of custody and admissibility in court.  
- **Image Fragmentation** is useful for large drives or storage limitations.
